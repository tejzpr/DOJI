The aim of the project is to implement seamless JAVA like packaging and importing functionality for JavaScript. 
Nowadays the size of JavaScript applications are increasing. The main problem of giving one large JS file as an application is that, 
the loading time for first load of the application takes a long time. DOJI seeks to minimize this loading delay by providing 
On Demand script access so that apps load faster. 

DOJI has two parts a Server side JavaScript aggregator and a small Javascript file which loads the source through ajax.
